    <!-- HERO MESSAGE -->
    <h1>Advancing Human Rights and Digital Inclusion in a Connected World</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>A Common Future (ACF)</strong> is a rights-based civil society organization
      founded in <strong>2007 in Bamenda, Cameroon</strong>, working at the intersection of
      <strong>human rights, digital transformation, and inclusive development</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For nearly two decades, ACF has championed the principle that
      <strong>human dignity, freedom, and equity must be safeguarded both offline and online</strong>.
      As societies digitize rapidly, we ensure that
      <strong>rights, inclusion, and the public interest</strong> remain central to
      technological progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work with <strong>communities, institutions, and global partners</strong>
      to build societies where <strong>technology expands opportunity rather than
      deepens inequality</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- FUTURE SECTION -->
    <h2>Shaping a Rights-Respecting Digital Future</h2>

    <p>
      Digital technologies increasingly shape access to
      <strong>education, identity, finance, governance, and civic participation</strong>.
      Yet across the <strong>Global South</strong>, millions remain
      <strong>digitally excluded</strong> or exposed to
      <strong>human rights risks online</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>A Common Future exists to close this gap.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We promote <strong>human rights and digital rights</strong>, strengthen
      <strong>digital inclusion</strong>, and advocate for the internet as a
      <strong>public good and digital public infrastructure</strong>
      that serves people—especially marginalized communities—first.
    </p>
