    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>A Common Future (ACF)</strong> is an independent, non-profit organization
      working to ensure that <strong>digital transformation advances justice,
      inclusion, and human dignity</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work bridges <strong>local realities and global policy spaces</strong>,
      contributing grounded perspectives to international conversations on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Digital rights</li>
      <li>Internet governance</li>
      <li>Digital public infrastructure</li>
      <li>Artificial intelligence and emerging technologies</li>
      <li>Rights-based development and humanitarian action</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We serve as a <strong>connector and convener</strong>, linking
      <strong>communities, policymakers, technologists, and development partners</strong>
      to shape digital futures that are inclusive, accountable, and people-centered.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>

    <p>We envision a world where:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Human rights are fully protected online and offline</li>
      <li>Digital spaces are open, safe, and inclusive</li>
      <li>Public-interest technology strengthens democracy and equity</li>
      <li>Marginalized communities shape digital futures, not just experience them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      To <strong>transform lives and build common frontiers</strong> by advancing
      <strong>human rights and digital inclusion</strong> through advocacy,
      research, education, and multi-stakeholder engagement.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>

    <h3>Rights-Based Framework</h3>
    <p>
      We integrate international human rights principles into digital policy,
      development work, and humanitarian action.
    </p>

    <h3>Community-Centered Solutions</h3>
    <p>
      We co-create programs with communities, ensuring that solutions respond
      to lived realities rather than imposed external models.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-Stakeholder Engagement</h3>
    <p>
      We foster dialogue and collaboration among civil society, government,
      academia, the private sector, and affected communities.
    </p>

    <h3>Evidence-Informed Advocacy</h3>
    <p>
      Our research, learning, and field insights inform advocacy, policy reform,
      and institutional practice at local, national, and global levels.
    </p>
